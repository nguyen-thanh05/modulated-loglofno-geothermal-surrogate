# Modulated LOGLO-FNO heterogeneous loss ablation

This study uses the completed
`configs/heterogeneous_dataset/modulated_loglo_hetero.yml` experiment as the full-loss
control. The control was trained with seeds 5, 42, and 2026; the ablation runs
use seed 42 for paired comparison and do not retrain the control.

Each ablation preserves the control configuration and disables exactly one
training component:

| Config | Disabled component |
| --- | --- |
| `modulated_loglo_hetero_no_h1.yml` | H1 loss |
| `modulated_loglo_hetero_no_mbe.yml` | Mass-balance loss |
| `modulated_loglo_hetero_no_spectral.yml` | Radial spectral loss |
| `modulated_loglo_hetero_no_meanfield.yml` | Mean-field pressure loss |
| `modulated_loglo_hetero_no_pushforward.yml` | Pushforward training |

MSE and the auxiliary BHP/energy loss remain enabled in every run. Disabled
loss weights are retained at their control values so the boolean toggle is the
only functional loss change.

All five experiments log to the W&B project
`MODULATED_LOGLOFNO_HETERO_loss_ablation` and use unique checkpoint filenames.
